## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning

- Handled negative quantities (returns)
- Saved cleaned dataset as `cleaned_online_retail.csv`

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Extracted time features (Year, Month, Day, Hour)
- Plotted monthly revenue trends
- Identified top 10 products by revenue
- Identified top 10 countries by revenue
- Analyzed returns overview

### 3. Customer Segmentation (RFM)
- Calculated Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) metrics per customer
- Log-transformed and standardized features
- Applied K-Means clustering (4 clusters)
- Saved RFM segments as `rfm_segments.csv`

### 4. Dashboard & Visualization
- Revenue trends by month
- Revenue by customer segment (clusters)
- Polished 3x2 subplot dashboard for products, countries, returns, and clusters
